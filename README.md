This project uses Azure Sphere MT3620, Microsoft Azure IOT Hub and Visual Studio to create a remote controller for home windows. 
The Azure Sphere device collects temperature and humidity data ultimately displayed to the end user via a web application.
The web application displays current local weather data using the Open Weather API. 
The user is able to decide whether they want to remotely open or close the window based on the displayed data - with the push of a button.
